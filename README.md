# Lua_tweenArtwork

This is a LÃ¶ve2D artwork generation code by using Lua library called Knife* and used tween functions for interpolating values.

There are some random multipliers that makes each particle in the scene behaving completely unique.

Also it will the unique in each and every generation. Hope someone will have fun with it just like I do!
